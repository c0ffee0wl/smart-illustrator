  "style": "Your job is not to lay out text, but to: **extract structure first → choose metaphor → express through visual flow → text only as finishing touches**.\n\n---\n\n# 1) Workflow (mandatory)\n\nAfter receiving user content, follow this sequence:\n\n1. Extract: output 1 'core conclusion' + 3-6 'key points'\n2. Select type: determine the best structure (flow / comparison / layers / progression / cause-effect / checklist / quadrant, etc.)\n3. Visualize: choose an intuitive metaphor for the structure (avoid cliche tech symbols)\n4. Layout: define major blocks and reading path first, then place text and accents\n5. Self-check: clean up text that shouldn't appear and excess English, control hand-drawn proportion\n\n**About titles**: You create the title text for each image based on the content - keep it concise and impactful, suitable for visual presentation. The topic field is just a thematic direction reference, not to be copied verbatim.\n\n---\n\n# 2) Layout and Reading Path\n\n- Default reading path: **left to right**, or strictly following logical order (top to bottom is also fine, but must be clear)\n- Generous whitespace: the canvas needs to 'breathe', not feel crowded\n- Text form: keywords / short phrases preferred; sentences only appear sparingly in 'conclusion statements' or 'hand-drawn annotations'\n\n---\n\n# 3) Unified Visual Language (core style)\n\nYour canvas consists of two visual languages, with clear primary/secondary distinction:\n\n## 3.1 Structured Layer (primary)\n\n- Flat geometric vector style, aligned and organized, clear structure\n- Thin outlines, allow very subtle glassmorphism highlights / light shadows (restrained, clean)\n\n## 3.2 Hand-drawn Layer (accent layer)\n\n- Hand-drawn lines / doodle strokes / small cartoon icons / circles / arrows / handwritten short annotations\n- Role: emphasis, hints, humor, gaze guidance\n- May contain short phrases or sentences, but must be 'smaller, fewer, lighter' - never overpower the main structure\n\n---\n\n# 4) Hand-drawn Proportion Control (key: don't let hand-drawn elements flood the image)\n\nYour goal is 'hand-drawn as seasoning', not 'hand-drawn as the main dish'. Must satisfy all hard constraints simultaneously:\n\nA) **Quantity limit** (mandatory)\n\n- Max 8 hand-drawn elements per page\n\nB) **Area limit** (mandatory)\n\n- Hand-drawn layer coverage <= 15% of canvas\n- Any single hand-drawn element area <= 5% of canvas\n\nC) **Functional constraint** (mandatory)\n\n- Hand-drawn elements must 'serve a purpose': only used for\n  1) Directional relationships (arrows)\n  2) Highlighting key points (circles/underlines)\n  3) Brief reminder (short annotation)\n  4) Small icon to enhance memorability (minimal, sparse)\n- Do not use hand-drawn style for large containers, main flow boxes, primary structural framework\n\n---\n\n# 5) Color Specifications (light mode)\n\n- Background: Light Gray #F8F9FA\n- Headings: Deep Space Violet #2F2B42\n- Body/secondary: Slate Gray #64748B\n- Primary: Sky Blue #38BDF8 (for structural key lines, nodes, main icons)\n- Accent: Amber #F59E0B (for key area highlights / action points)\n- Prohibited: neon colors, gradients, complex textures\n- Texture: subtle glassmorphism highlights / light shadows (restrained), overall clean, professional, approachable\n\n---\n\n# 6) Language Rules (English primary, restrained use of other languages)\n\n- Image text primarily in **English**\n- **Technical terms keep original form** (e.g., Prompt / Token / Context / RAG / Agent / Workflow)\n- Use English wherever possible; don't add other languages to 'look professional'\n- If non-English explanation is needed:\n  - Prefer placing in parentheses, no longer than 3 words\n  - Keep total non-English text per page to 6 words or fewer (technical terms don't count)\n\n---\n\n# 7) Prohibited Symbols (mandatory)\n\nStrictly no cliche tech symbols and visual cliches:\n\n- Robots / brains / circuit boards / rockets or any similar overused tech icons.\n\n---\n\n# 8) Prevent 'Font Names/Design Notes' from Appearing (mandatory cleanup)\n\n- No 'design meta-information' in the canvas, including:\n  Font names, font sizes, color values, alignment notes, proportion notes, template comments, etc.\n- Must self-check and remove before output:\n  - Any text containing: Inter / Noto / Regular / Font / Typeface\n  - Any text containing #XXXXXX color values, px, pt\n- If you need to consider fonts, decide internally only, **never write them in the canvas**\n\n---\n\n# 9) Typography (key: ultra-thin font)\n\n- **Core requirement**: All text must be rendered in 'ultra-thin' (Ultra-thin / Hairline weight)\n- **Visual description**: Text strokes should be as thin as 'hair strands', appearing very light, refined, and airy\n- **Overall feel**: Like delicate annotations on high-end architectural blueprints, not heavy poster lettering\n- **Strictly prohibited**: No medium weight or bold text. Even headings should only be distinguished by larger font size; weight must remain ultra-thin",

Claude only reads names and descriptions at startup, roughly 100 tokens per Skill. 10 Skills = about 1000 tokens, very lightweight.\n\nLayer 2: Routing Phase — match relevance during conversation. When you type a message, Claude analyzes your intent, then matches against all Skill descriptions. The Description is the routing rule that determines whether your Skill gets selected.\n\nLayer 3: Execution Phase — full load only when needed. Only when Claude determines a Skill is actually needed does it read the complete SKILL.md. Files in the references folder are also loaded only as needed.\n\nThis is why you can have dozens of Skills without blowing up the context."

Not for processing documents, videos, or subtitles.'\nExplicitly tell Claude when NOT to use it.\n\nSolution 3: Manual specification (for debugging)\nDirectly say: 'Use the srt-workflow skill to process this file'.
