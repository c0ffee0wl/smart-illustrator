# Deep Research Report on `JimLiu/baoyu-skills` Article Illustration Capabilities and Competitive Differentiation

## Executive summary

The `JimLiu/baoyu-skills` repository is a collection of **Agent Skills** designed to run inside **Claude Code’s plugin/skills ecosystem**, installed via `npx skills add` (and/or via Claude Code’s marketplace UI). The repo groups skills into three plugin bundles—**content generation/publishing**, **AI generation backends**, and **utility tools**—with explicit prerequisites of a Node.js environment and the ability to run `npx bun` commands. citeturn26view0turn32search8

Within this collection, **`baoyu-article-illustrator`** is best understood as an **automation-oriented “article-to-illustrations pipeline”**: it analyses an article (file path or pasted content), identifies *where* visuals add value, chooses a **Type × Style** combination (with optional auto-selection), generates an illustration outline and per-image prompts, calls an image-generation backend skill, then inserts generated images into the article with Markdown image syntax and language-appropriate alt text. citeturn27view0turn13view0

From a competitive standpoint, the project’s strongest differentiator is **editorial automation** (finding illustration positions and updating Markdown) rather than raw generation quality. Most commercial tools excel at **generating or editing assets**, but they usually don’t provide this *opinionated, end-to-end, article-structure-aware* insertion workflow. citeturn13view0turn28search3turn17search3

To surpass competitors, the most leverage comes from integrating newer advances—especially **style references**, **vector/diagram-native outputs**, and **quality selection loops**—while preserving the repo’s existing strengths: structured workflow, reusability via Agent Skills, and multi-backend image generation. citeturn22view0turn18search1turn25view0

## Current state of repository capabilities

The repository is distributed as an Agent Skills collection and can be installed via `npx skills add jimliu/baoyu-skills` or integrated via Claude Code’s marketplace command (`/plugin marketplace add ...`) and plugin installer (`/plugin install ...`). The README explicitly lists **content-skills** (including `article-illustrator`), **ai-generation-skills** (including `image-gen` and `danger-gemini-web`), and **utility-skills** (e.g., URL-to-Markdown, image compression). citeturn26view0turn15view4

### How `baoyu-article-illustrator` works today

At the user-interface level, the skill is invoked as a **slash command** (or analogous agent invocation) such as:

- `/baoyu-article-illustrator path/to/article.md`
- optionally with `--type` and/or `--style` overrides (e.g., `--type flowchart --style notion`) citeturn27view0turn14search0

The core product concept is a **two-dimensional control system**:

- **Type** = the information structure (infographic, scene, flowchart, comparison, framework, timeline)
- **Style** = the visual aesthetic/mood (notion, elegant, warm, minimal, blueprint, watercolor, editorial, scientific) citeturn27view0turn13view0

The specification includes **auto-selection heuristics** mapping content signals to recommended type/style (e.g., “metrics/data” → infographic; “how-to steps” → flowchart; “history/progress” → timeline). citeturn13view0turn14search0

### Workflow orchestration and “UI elements” inside the agent

The skill’s “UI” is primarily an **interactive, checklist-driven conversation** plus structured outputs on disk:

- A copyable progress checklist (Step 1 through Step 6) citeturn13view0turn14search0  
- **AskUserQuestion-based** decision points (output directory, existing image handling, article update method, and a required “confirm settings” step that consolidates multiple questions into one call) citeturn13view0turn14search0  
- Output artefacts that make the process auditable and editable: `outline.md`, prompt files under `prompts/`, and sequentially named images (e.g., `NN-{type}-{slug}.png`). citeturn13view0turn14search0

A particularly important implementation detail is that **Step 3 (Confirm Settings) is marked “REQUIRED”** and instructs the agent not to skip it. This is effectively a guardrail against the most common failure mode in illustration automation: generating a batch of images in the wrong style/density with no user checkpoint. citeturn13view0turn14search0

### Integration methods and dependencies

The article illustrator is designed to run *with* separate image-generation skills. In Step 5 it explicitly requires the agent to **select an available generation skill** (and ask the user if multiple are installed). citeturn13view0turn14search0

In this repo, the primary “backends” relevant to illustration generation are:

- **`baoyu-image-gen` (official API-based)**: supports **OpenAI and Google providers**, explicit `--provider`, model selection, aspect ratio presets, quality presets, reference images (Google multimodal only), and **parallel generation using background subagents** (recommended concurrency 4, max 8). It also documents environment variables for API keys and model overrides, and it includes basic error handling (retry once on failure, warnings for invalid aspect ratios, etc.). citeturn25view0turn17search3  
- **`baoyu-gemini-web` / `baoyu-danger-gemini-web` (reverse-engineered Gemini Web)**: supports text generation, image generation, reference images for vision input, and multi-turn sessions via `--sessionId`. Critically, these skills implement a **mandatory consent/disclaimer flow** and save consent to OS-specific paths before use, acknowledging the fragility and “use at your own risk” nature of reverse-engineered web APIs. citeturn24view0turn24view1

This repo-level design creates a modular stack:

```mermaid
flowchart LR
  A[Article: .md or pasted content] --> B[baoyu-article-illustrator\nAnalyse → positions → outline → prompts]
  B --> C{Select backend}
  C --> D[baoyu-image-gen\n(OpenAI/Google official APIs)]
  C --> E[baoyu-gemini-web\n(reverse-engineered web API + consent)]
  D --> F[Images saved (NN-type-slug.png)]
  E --> F
  F --> G[Markdown updated\nwith image links + alt text]
```

This separation of concerns aligns closely with the broader **Agent Skills architecture** described by Anthropic: skills bundle instructions and optional scripts/resources, and agents load detailed content on demand (progressive disclosure). citeturn32search4turn32search3

### Customisation hooks already present

The `baoyu-article-illustrator` design includes a configuration mechanism via `EXTEND.md` located either in a project directory or user home directory. The spec states it supports at least: watermark, preferred type/style, custom styles, language, and output directory preferences. citeturn13view0turn14search0

On the backend side, `baoyu-image-gen` also supports `EXTEND.md` preferences (default provider/quality/aspect ratio). citeturn25view0

A practical implication: the project already has the skeleton of a “brand kit” concept (persistent defaults, custom styles), but it does not yet appear to reach the depth of commercial design suites (brand assets, font systems, templated layouts, etc.). citeturn13view0turn28search5turn28search9

## Competitive landscape of article illustration tools

This landscape breaks into three overlapping categories: **creative suites**, **generation-first tools**, and **workflow/diagram specialists**. The most direct competition to *article illustration automation* is often not an “image generator” per se, but tools that improve *speed + consistency + editability* of visuals in publishing workflows.

### Creative suites with embedded generation and brand controls

**Canva** positions itself as a visual suite with AI tooling (Magic Studio / Magic Design / AI image generation) and strong brand governance (Brand Kits with centralised logos/colours/fonts and multi-brand management). This makes Canva a strong competitor for teams that care about *on-brand consistency* and rapid production with templates. citeturn28search8turn28search5turn17search4

**Strengths (relative to `baoyu-article-illustrator`)**
- Built-in brand systems and template-driven workflows (Brand Kit, brand features). citeturn28search5turn28search26  
- Rich UI for composing multi-element graphics and resizing/reformatting designs quickly (Magic Design positioning). citeturn28search1turn17search20  

**Weaknesses (relative to `baoyu-article-illustrator`)**
- Typically does **not** natively analyse a Markdown article to decide illustration positions and insert image links into the source file; the workflow is often “create assets, then manually place them”. (This is an inference based on Canva’s product positioning around design creation rather than article-structure-aware insertion; validate against your target publishing workflow.) citeturn28search1turn28search0turn13view0  

**Adobe Firefly + Adobe Express** competes similarly, with an emphasis on generative features integrated into creation workflows and explicit positioning around responsible/commercial usage. Firefly’s Text-to-Image marketing claims commercial safety via training on licensed Adobe Stock and public-domain content, and Express promotes fast creation with templates plus generative tools. citeturn17search1turn28search6turn28search21

### Generation-first platforms with advanced style/consistency controls

**Midjourney** is a leading “generation-first” competitor, especially where stylistic quality dominates. It offers:
- **Style Reference** via `--sref` and adjustable style weight `--sw` citeturn17search6turn29search21  
- **Character/Omni Reference** to maintain consistency across generations citeturn17search2turn17search18  
- A web **Editor** supporting Remix, inpainting (“Vary Region”), pan, and zoom out. citeturn28search3turn29search1  

These map directly onto gaps in the current `baoyu-article-illustrator` pipeline: it is strong at “where and what to illustrate,” but weaker at “iterative visual refinement, consistency locking, and user-friendly editing”.

**Ideogram** is especially relevant for **articles that need text-heavy visuals** (covers, callout cards, posters, typographic illustrations). Ideogram’s documentation explicitly emphasises strength in **text and typography inside images**, and Ideogram 3.0 markets “text and layout generation” for professional design use cases. citeturn18search0turn22view0

Ideogram 3.0 also introduces **Style References** (up to 3 reference images) and reusable **Style Codes**, which is a highly actionable concept for this repo’s “Type × Style” system (a Style Code can become a persistent style identifier in `EXTEND.md` or in project-level configuration). citeturn22view0

**OpenAI (Image API / DALL·E)** is also strategically important because the repo’s official backend can call OpenAI. The OpenAI Image API supports **generations, edits, and (for older models) variations**, and current docs describe multiple model options (including GPT Image models and DALL·E 3). citeturn17search3turn17search7  
OpenAI’s DALL·E 3 announcements stress improved prompt adherence (reducing “prompt engineering tax”), which is directly aligned with the repo’s goal of reliable, automation-friendly illustration generation. citeturn29search0turn29search4

### Open-source creative engines and workflow UIs

For self-hosted or power-user scenarios, the strongest open-source competitors are less “article-aware” but extremely strong in **control, repeatability, and editing**:

- **ComfyUI**: node/graph/flowchart interface for building complex diffusion workflows; emphasises modular pipelines, many model integrations, and optimisation via re-executing only changed graph parts. citeturn22view1turn19search11  
- **AUTOMATIC1111 Stable Diffusion WebUI**: a Gradio-based web interface with a large extension ecosystem. citeturn19search10turn19search7  
- **InvokeAI**: emphasises a “Unified Canvas” for in/out-painting and AI-first editing workflows. citeturn19search8turn19search12  
- **ControlNet** (and related tooling) enables strong conditioning control (sketch/edges/pose/etc.), widely adopted across SD toolchains. citeturn19search1turn19search4  

**Key insight:** Open-source stacks often win on **controllability** (ControlNet, inpainting/outpainting, workflow graphs), while `baoyu-article-illustrator` wins on **editorial orchestration** (analyse article → decide positions → insert into Markdown). A best-in-class product would unify both: keep orchestration while adding controllability and editability loops.

### Diagram-first and layout-first competitors (strong for “flowchart/framework/timeline”)

Many article visuals are *better as editable diagrams than raster art*. Competitors here include:

- **Miro AI diagram generation from text**: generates editable diagrams from text prompts, supports multiple diagram types, and markets time savings and iterative refinement. citeturn33search2turn33search14  
- **Lucidchart with Lucid AI**: generates diagrams from text directly on the canvas and supports iterative prompting. citeturn33search1turn33search17  
- **Whimsical AI**: text-to-flowchart generation (powered by ChatGPT per their page) with a UI focused on fast diagramming. citeturn33search0turn33search12  
- **Excalidraw** (open source): hand-drawn style diagramming and exports, aimed at quick, sketch-like visuals. citeturn33search3turn33search19  

The repo currently lists “flowchart/framework/timeline” types, but relying purely on text-to-image generation for these can lead to legibility issues and non-editable outputs. Diagram-first tools solve this with structured diagram representations.

## Recent advances relevant to next-generation article illustration

Recent progress is especially relevant in three areas: **prompt adherence and consistency**, **layout-aware generation**, and **interactive/dynamic illustration outputs**.

### Better prompt adherence and automated prompt optimisation

Modern image systems increasingly address the “ignored words” problem. OpenAI explicitly frames DALL·E 3 as a step forward in prompt adherence and notes API-side prompt rewriting/optimisation in developer guidance. citeturn29search0turn29search4  
Research also continues to explore systematic improvements to prompt adherence, including work arguing that structured captions can improve controllability. citeturn29search8

For this project, the practical product implication is: **don’t treat prompt construction as static templates only**. Add automated prompt refinement loops (while preserving the user’s intent), much like tool-assisted “prompt rewriting” approaches. citeturn29search4turn29search16

### Style references and reusable style identifiers

“Style references” have become a mainstream UX primitive:

- Midjourney’s Style Reference (`--sref`) and style weight (`--sw`). citeturn17search6turn29search21  
- Ideogram 3.0’s Style References (up to 3 images) plus reusable Style Codes. citeturn22view0  

This is a direct evolution path for `Type × Style`: keep the conceptual model, but allow a “Style” to be anchored by **reference images and persistent IDs**, not only text descriptors.

### Layout generation and layout-to-image controllability

Two separate “layout” threads matter for article illustration:

- **Graphic layout generation** (how to place elements on a canvas): LayoutDiffusion models layout as a discrete diffusion process and reports improved performance on layout datasets. citeturn20search0  
- **Layout-to-image controllability** (generate an image matching a specified layout map): “LayoutDiffusion” (CVPR 2023 line of work) targets stronger control over global layout and object-level placement. citeturn20search3turn20search5  

While implementing these models directly may be heavy, the *product-level translate* is clear: **explicit layout specs** (even lightweight ones—grids, bounding boxes, or templated layouts) can make outputs more consistent and “publication ready”.

### Vector, editable, and dynamic illustration formats

The next differentiation frontier is not only “make an image,” but “make an asset that works well in articles”:

- **Vector outputs (SVG)**: Recraft positions itself as able to generate vector artwork from prompts and export to SVG, with additional export formats including Lottie. citeturn18search1turn18search13  
- **Lottie animations**: Lottie is a JSON-based animation format designed to ship scalable animations across platforms, with an open specification and broad ecosystem tooling. citeturn21search12turn21search8  
- **Interactive graphics**: Vega/Vega-Lite provide declarative specs for interactive visualisations rendered via SVG or Canvas; D3 enables bespoke DOM-driven visualisations. citeturn21search2turn21search18turn21search3  
- **Scroll-driven animation**: modern CSS supports scroll-linked animation concepts (e.g., `scroll-timeline` and related patterns), enabling “scrollytelling” without heavy JS in some cases. citeturn20search9turn20search13  

This matters because articles increasingly compete on *engagement*, and interactive or animated micro-illustrations can differentiate content—especially for “framework” or “process” explanations.

## Prioritized feature roadmap to surpass competitors

This roadmap is prioritised by expected user value, scalability, and alignment with the project’s core goal (article-aware illustration), while factoring implementation complexity in an Agent Skills ecosystem.

### Comparison table of competitor capabilities versus proposed enhancements

| Capability | Current `baoyu-article-illustrator` | Strong competitors today | Proposed enhancement to surpass |
|---|---|---|---|
| Article-aware illustration placement + Markdown insertion | Yes: identifies positions, updates article with Markdown image links and alt text citeturn13view0turn14search0 | WordPress plugins often generate featured images but don’t generally do deep per-section placement citeturn31search1 | Add “in-article preview + approval + diff” loop (see below) |
| Style consistency across a series | Type × Style system + preferences via EXTEND.md citeturn13view0turn14search0 | Midjourney Style/Omni Reference; Ideogram Style References/Style Codes citeturn17search6turn22view0 | “Style-lock” with reference images + persistent style IDs integrated into EXTEND.md |
| Editing/inpainting/outpainting workflow | Not specified in the article illustrator skill | Midjourney Editor (Vary Region/Pan/Zoom); InvokeAI Unified Canvas citeturn28search3turn19search8 | Add iterative “edit request → regenerate region” workflows (backend permitting) |
| Diagram-native / editable outputs (flowchart/framework/timeline) | Defined types exist, but output is saved as raster images citeturn13view0turn27view0 | Miro/Lucid/Whimsical generate editable diagrams from text citeturn33search2turn33search1turn33search0 | Generate Mermaid/Vega-Lite/Excalidraw JSON + optional render-to-SVG pipeline |
| Brand governance (colours/fonts/templates across assets) | Partial via EXTEND preferences and “custom styles” concept citeturn13view0turn25view0 | Canva Brand Kit; Venngage AI branding automation citeturn28search5turn31search7 | Add first-class “Brand Pack” (palette, typography rules, icon set, watermark policy) |
| Multi-backend generation + automation scalability | Yes: backend selection; image-gen supports parallel generation (subagents) citeturn13view0turn25view0 | ComfyUI graph pipelines; Stability API suite citeturn22view1turn22view2 | Add quality scoring + candidate ranking at scale; add caching and reproducibility metadata |

### Highest-priority enhancements

**Style-lock with reference images and reusable “style IDs”**  
User value is high because style drift is the most common complaint in series illustrations. The project already supports preferences via `EXTEND.md`, and the official backend supports reference images (Google multimodal) plus provider/model selection. Build a “style lock” mode:
- Accept 1–3 reference images (similar to Ideogram 3.0 and Midjourney’s style references). citeturn22view0turn17search6turn25view0  
- Store a `style_id` plus constraints (palette keywords, line weight, background rules) in `EXTEND.md`.  
- Enforce that every image prompt includes the style lock instructions and references.  
Implementation complexity is moderate because `baoyu-image-gen` already supports `--ref` and configuration precedence rules. citeturn25view0

**Multi-candidate generation + automated best-pick (“quality router”)**  
Competitors implicitly do this via interactive UI (users pick the best of 4 or iterate). Your pipeline can automate it:
- Generate 2–4 candidates per slot (parallelised; the repo already documents a scalable background-subagent approach). citeturn25view0  
- Use a lightweight evaluation pass: vision model checks for prompt adherence, illegible text, style mismatch, and layout clarity (especially for flowcharts).  
- Save all candidates but insert only the best-scoring into the article; allow `/regenerate` per slot.  
This converts an interactive trial-and-error workflow into a mostly automatic one, which is a direct competitive advantage over manual design tools. (The “generate four then pick” pattern is consistent with how many generation tools present outputs, e.g., Midjourney’s quality/cost relationship and generation sets. citeturn28search7turn28search3)

**Diagram-native modes for flowchart/framework/timeline**  
For “flowchart” and “framework”, consider making the *primary output a diagram spec* (Mermaid, Vega-Lite, or Excalidraw JSON), and optionally provide a rendered SVG/PNG fallback. GitHub and many Markdown renderers support Mermaid; Vega-Lite enables interactive charts; Excalidraw enables a hand-drawn style consistent with parts of your style gallery concept. citeturn21search21turn21search2turn33search3  
This yields:
- better text legibility (because text is text, not pixels),
- editability,
- future-proofing (theme changes, responsive layouts).

Implementation complexity ranges from moderate (emit Mermaid code blocks) to higher (automated render + embed pipeline), but the differentiation is substantial because diagram tools like Miro/Lucid/Whimsical already win here. citeturn33search2turn33search1turn33search0

### Medium-priority enhancements

**In-article preview, approval, and “diff-based update” UX**  
Today the skill can update the original file or create a copy, and it inserts images after corresponding paragraphs. citeturn13view0  
To improve user trust and reduce “automation anxiety”:
- Generate an “illustrated preview” build (Markdown → HTML) and show a diff summary of insertions (slot positions, filenames, alt text).  
- Require a final “approve changes” checkpoint before writing back.  
This is similar in spirit to mature publishing tools that emphasise review before publish.

**Responsive image and asset pipeline (multiple sizes + `<picture>`)**  
For web publishing, generate multiple sizes per image and insert responsive markup where supported. MDN outlines standard responsive image approaches (`<picture>`, art direction). citeturn20search2  
This pairs naturally with the repo’s existing “output directory conventions” and facilitates performance and layout stability.

**End-to-end “publish-ready” pipeline orchestration**  
Because the repo already includes cover image generation and publishing skills, create a unified orchestration skill (e.g., `/baoyu-publish-article`) to:
1) run article illustration,  
2) generate a cover (`baoyu-cover-image` supports multi-dimensional customisation and a quick mode),  
3) compress assets (`baoyu-compress-image` exists as a utility skill in the repo listing),  
4) publish to WeChat/X using existing automation skills. citeturn27view0turn15view2turn26view0  
This would be highly aligned with “article illustration skills” as a productivity system, not a standalone generator.

### Longer-term differentiators

**Interactive/dynamic illustration outputs**  
Offer optional output modes:
- Lottie micro-animations for key concepts (for platforms that support embedding), leveraging the broader Lottie ecosystem and spec. citeturn21search12turn21search8  
- Scroll-driven “scrollytelling” snippets for web-first articles, guided by modern CSS scroll animation primitives. citeturn20search9turn20search13  
- Vega-Lite interactive charts for data-heavy articles. citeturn21search2turn21search6  

This is higher complexity and may not fit all publishing channels (e.g., WeChat article constraints), but it clearly differentiates versus static-image generators.

**Layout-aware generation using explicit layout templates**  
Borrow the product idea from layout-generation research: define a small set of “layout templates” for each Type (e.g., comparison grids, timeline axis layouts) and enforce them. LayoutDiffusion and layout-to-image controllability research reinforces that explicit layout modelling improves controllability. citeturn20search0turn20search3  
You do not need to implement the full research stack—template constraints plus diagram-native outputs can get 80% of the benefit with far lower engineering cost.

### Suggested visual aids for your internal documentation and stakeholder alignment

A few diagrams/charts will materially improve clarity and decision-making:

- A **system architecture diagram** showing the current pipeline (article → analyse → outline/prompts → backend selection → images → markdown update) and where proposed modules plug in (style-lock, quality router, diagram-native outputs). This mirrors the modular Agent Skills philosophy. citeturn32search4turn25view0  
- A **competitive landscape quadrant**:  
  - X-axis: “Editorial automation (article-aware)”  
  - Y-axis: “Asset controllability/editability”  
  Plot `baoyu-article-illustrator`, Canva/Adobe, Midjourney/Ideogram, ComfyUI/InvokeAI, and Miro/Lucid/Whimsical.  
- A **feature heatmap** (the comparison table can be expanded) mapping “Type × Style”, brand governance, style references, diagram-native outputs, editing loops, publishing integration.  
- A **roadmap burndown** of the prioritised features by complexity vs user value (a simple matrix is enough).

If you want one “north star” visual: create a single-page diagram titled **“From Markdown to publish-ready illustrated article”**, explicitly showing optional branches for raster, SVG, Mermaid, and interactive outputs, and which channels (WeChat/X/web) can consume each output type.
